# professorEST-api

I was asked by a local company called professorEST to store their data online and allow them to query that data using certain parameters from either a phone or a webpage.

I decided to use Nodejs/Express to handle the http requests and mongodb to store database.
Additional tools I'm using for development: Nodemon to keep track of the changes to the server, Postman to simulate GET/POST/DELETE/PATCH requests to the server, Morgan as a middleware to log the requests to the console, Locus to check values of variables for a smoother development.
